                            <p> An inquisitive and determined problem solver, I was fortunate enough to spend 11 
                                years working as a high school 
                            science teacher at a wonderful public school.  I believe that the times of transition 
                            in my life are especially dense with memory and learning. Going to graduate school, being 
                            a first-year teacher, becoming a father - all of these made me a better, more resilient 
                            person.  This spirit of growth has brought me to my studies at the Flatiron School to 
                            prepare for a new career in software engineering.  I am excited to continue developing a
                            set of skills that allow me to create authentic, technically complex work.</p>
